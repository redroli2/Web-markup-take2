                <h2>Care Instructions:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>There is enough food available for each cat.</li>
                    <li>Please feed the cat once in the morning and once in the evening. You will find pre-packaged cans in the apartment. One can
                        corresponds to one meal.</li>
                    <li>Please also give the cat enough to drink.</li>
                    <li>There are cat flaps in the apartment. The cat goes out and back in on its own. Please
                        do not pressure it to do anything.</li>
                    <li>The cats know their way around the city well. Do not worry if they are outside sometimes.
                        They come back to the apartment quickly and happily.</li>
                    <li>There is also a litter box in the apartment, which needs to be emptied every 2 days. You will find the necessary utensils for that
                        in the apartment. The business then goes into an extra trash can next to the litter box.</li>
                    <li>Please show the cat that you care about it. Please do not abuse the cat or cause
                        it any harm. The cats are trained to give us owners a sign if something like that happens
                        should.</li>
                    <li>Cuddling sessions with the cat are also welcome, because they like that the most:)</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>That's it. Don't be put off by the list. It looks more than it is. The
                    most important thing is that you have fun with the whole thing and have a good time with the cat in a beautiful
                    city! See you soon:)</strong></p>
